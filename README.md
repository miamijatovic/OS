# Operating Systems â€“ Assignment 1 & Assignment 2

This repository contains two C programs created for the **Operating Systems** course. The tasks focus on signal handling, file operations, shared memory, and mutual exclusion.

- `zadatak2.c` â€“ Mutual exclusion using Petersonâ€™s algorithm

## ðŸ§  Assignment 1: Signals and File Handling

### Description
The program in `zadatak1.c` continuously calculates squares of natural numbers and writes them to `obrada.txt` every 5 seconds. It uses `status.txt` to store the last processed number so that it can resume correctly after being terminated.

### Handled Signals:

- `SIGUSR1` â€“ Prints the currently processed number
- `SIGTERM` â€“ Writes the last number to `status.txt` and gracefully exits
- `SIGINT` â€“ Exits immediately without saving state

### How to Run
```bash

kill -SIGUSR1 <PID>   # Show the current number
kill -SIGTERM <PID>   # Save progress and exit

Assignment 2: Mutual Exclusion
Description

zadatak2.c implements Petersonâ€™s algorithm to ensure mutual exclusion between two processes accessing a critical section. Each process prints its ID and counters (k, m) to demonstrate interleaved execution.
Key Features:

    Shared memory (mmap)

    Petersonâ€™s algorithm for synchronization

    Nested loops to simulate workload

How to Run

gcc -o zadatak2 zadatak2.c
./zadatak2

Expected output will alternate between the two processes:

Process 0: k = 1, m = 1
Process 1: k = 1, m = 1
...

gcc -o zadatak1 zadatak1.c -lm
./zadatak1
