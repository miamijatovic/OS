# Operating Systems â€“ Assignment 1 & Assignment 2

This repository contains two C programs created for the **Operating Systems** course. The tasks focus on signal handling, file operations, shared memory, and mutual exclusion.

## ðŸ§  Assignment 1: Signals and File Handling

### Description
The program in `zadatak1.c` continuously calculates squares of natural numbers and writes them to `obrada.txt` every 5 seconds. It uses `status.txt` to store the last processed number so that it can resume correctly after being terminated.

### Handled Signals:

- `SIGUSR1` â€“ Prints the currently processed number
- `SIGTERM` â€“ Writes the last number to `status.txt` and gracefully exits
- `SIGINT` â€“ Exits immediately without saving state

### How to Run
```bash
gcc -o zadatak1 zadatak1.c -lm
./zadatak1
